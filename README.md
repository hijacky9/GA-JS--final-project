# App Name: Popular Movie App 


## Why should I make it?
As a movie lover, the app user would like to get the the most popular movies from the themoviedb.org open API. I would like to see the rating of the movies and add favourites to my list which stores in the superbase, and can be retrieved by clicking on hearted button.
